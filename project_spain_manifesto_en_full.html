        <h2>Manifesto of the Common Spaniard</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
<h3>1. Defense and Borders</h3>
<p>Spain must regain control. Not only of its borders, but of its dignity. Strengthening the southern frontier with resolve is essential.</p>
<h3>2. Hispanic Alliance</h3>
<p>Latin America is not foreign to us. It is our history and our future. We promote a real union between Hispanic American states.</p>
<h3>3. Liberty, Not Subsidies</h3>
<p>Full respect for identity, gender, and religion. But the State does not subsidize beliefs or personal decisions. Being of any chosen gender carries no public economic compensation.</p>
<h3>4. End to Political Corruption</h3>
<p>Lifetime pensions for politicians are abolished. Being a public representative is an honor, not a privilege. The size of the political apparatus is reduced.</p>
<h3>5. Symbolic Monarchy</h3>
<p>We recognize the diplomatic role of the Royal House. It is maintained as a military honorary symbol and High National Diplomatic Representation.</p>
<h3>6. Simplification of the State</h3>
<p>Complete audit of public spending. Useless expenditures are eliminated. Goodbye to advisors and positions nobody understands.</p>
<h3>7. Useful Education</h3>
<p>Only degrees with real market demand will be subsidized. Public education must cease to be ideological and become practical again.</p>
<h3>8. Rational Subsidies</h3>
<p>Only two: basic income and unemployment benefits. The minimum income is conditional on training and active job search.</p>
<h3>9. Real Justice</h3>
<p>Harsher sentences, removal of prison privileges. New prisons built under minimum legal conditions but strict regimes.</p>
<h3>10. End of Squatting</h3>
<p>A residence is legal only if you are the owner or have a rental contract. Social cases are relocated. Criminals go to jail. Illegal immigrants are deported.</p>
<h3>11. Catalonia and the Basque Country</h3>
<p>They are part of Spain, with their culture and language. But privileges and political blackmail are over. A national referendum will be proposed if necessary. Those who want to leave will be told the truth. Those who stay are my brothers and sisters.</p>
<h3>12. National Energy</h3>
<p>Nuclear plants remain active. New ones will be considered. Spain will no longer depend on foreign energy. Total energy autonomy.</p>
<h3>13. Real Defense</h3>
<p>Increased defense budget, reinforced southern border, modernized army. Spain demands respect.</p>
<h3>14. Responsible Civil Service</h3>
<p>Real performance reviews. Those who serve stay. Those who don't, are dismissed.</p>
<h3>15. Healthcare with Purpose</h3>
<p>More direct funding for doctors, nurses, and real medical staff. Wasteful spending is over.</p>
<h3>16. Sovereign Agriculture</h3>
<p>Fair prices, national logistics, and equal conditions for national producers versus imports.</p>
<h3>17. EU with Respect</h3>
<p>Spain is unquestionably part of the EU. We demand support to control the southern border alongside Portugal and Italy. Gibraltar is Spanish—and thus European.</p>
<h3>18. NGOs and Subsidies</h3>
<p>All aid is audited. Only causes that benefit the collective interest are funded. First, we help our homeless and hungry.</p>
<h3>19. Technology as an Ally</h3>
<p>Spain embraces AI, automation, and strong tech alliances. Big Tech friendly—but under national digital sovereignty. Technology must serve the people.</p>
<p>There is still much to define and develop, but these are basic ideas that most Spaniards should agree upon.</p>
<p>You may agree with some points and disagree with others—fair enough. But think about what you've lived through:</p>
<p>A state that only works when nothing is happening. What happened during the floods in Valencia? During COVID? During blackouts? They’re useless in crisis. The system DOES NOT WORK.</p>
<p>Who was responsible? The PP? The PSOE? Was it you? Was it them? It was everyone. It was no one. No one ever shows up when it matters.</p>
<p>And worse yet—they’re expensive. And they rob us.</p>
<p>Enough is enough. If you’re tired of being robbed, lied to, and ignored, then you’re not alone.</p>
<p>This project isn’t signed by a politician. It’s signed by a common Spaniard.</p>
<p><strong>Sign it. Share it. Make history.</strong></p>
